# Comments:

I was able to learn a lot about building a web API from scratch using ASP.NET. I started the project on the 5/06/2022 and was able to learn the basic concepts of ASP.NET and APIs fast enough. Unfortunately, I was not able to do certain optional tasks due to time constraints. I also have good knowledge of Android Development with Java and can be viewed from my Repo: https://github.com/Oomeeth/Cr8v-Properties. Thank you.
